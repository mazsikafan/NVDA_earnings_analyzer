        "NVIDIA Corporation reported exceptional financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, with record revenue of $35.1 billion representing a 94% increase compared to the same period last year. Data center revenue reached unprecedented levels of $30.8 billion, reflecting a 112% year-over-year growth rate driven by sustained demand for our advanced GPU computing platforms. The strong performance was attributed to widespread adoption of artificial intelligence applications across cloud service providers, enterprise customers, and consumer internet companies. Our Hopper architecture continued to demonstrate market leadership in AI training and inference workloads, while early customer feedback for our upcoming Blackwell platform has been overwhelmingly positive. Gaming revenue contributed $2.9 billion to total revenue, representing a 15% sequential increase driven by robust demand for our RTX 40 series graphics cards. Professional visualization revenue of $463 million and automotive revenue of $346 million further diversified our revenue base. Gross margin expanded to 75.0% for the quarter, reflecting operational efficiency improvements and favorable product mix. We maintained our commitment to research and development with continued investment in next-generation architectures." * 2
